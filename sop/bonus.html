        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This SOP details the Bonus Team's responsibilities in managing user bonuses, monitoring for abuse, and ensuring compliance with promotional terms.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate and apply bonuses based on promotions, ensuring compliance with company policies.</li>
            <li>Monitor for patterns of bonus abuse, such as multi-account usage or suspicious referral codes.</li>
            <li>Provide assistance to CS agents on bonus-related inquiries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
        <h3>1. Bonus Calculation and Application</h3>
        <p>Verify eligibility based on promotion terms and calculate the bonus amount. Ensure accurate application and document all transactions.</p>

        <h3>2. Detecting Bonus Abuse</h3>
        <p>Monitor for abusive patterns, such as accounts claiming bonuses excessively or using obscure referral codes. If detected, follow up with Fraud and KYC teams.</p>

        <h3>3. Responding to CS Inquiries</h3>
        <p>Assist CS agents with bonus-related inquiries, providing them with up-to-date promotional terms and eligibility criteria.</p>

        <h2>Escalation Protocols</h2>
        <p>For suspected abuse, escalate cases to Fraud or KYC via Slack. Request additional documentation, such as ID and selfie with Gambi paper, if necessary.</p>
