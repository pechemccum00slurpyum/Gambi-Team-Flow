        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This SOP outlines the joint efforts of the Risk, Fraud, and KYC teams in identifying, investigating, and handling high-risk user activities.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk Team: Assess risks associated with high-value deposits and coin mixing behaviors.</li>
            <li>Fraud Team: Investigate patterns indicating multi-account usage, referral abuse, and other fraudulent behaviors.</li>
            <li>KYC Team: Verify user identity through document review when escalated by Risk and Fraud teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
        <h3>1. Joint Initial Assessment by Risk and Fraud Teams</h3>
        <p>Both teams assess high-value deposits and look for signs of coin mixing or other AML risks. If suspicious activity is detected, proceed to detailed account analysis.</p>

        <h3>2. Detailed Account Analysis</h3>
        <p>Analyze user account details, looking for similar names, IPs, devices, and wallet addresses. If multi-account use is suspected, request ID, selfie, and Gambi paper.</p>

        <h3>3. Document Verification by KYC Team</h3>
        <p>The KYC Team verifies submitted documents and checks consistency with linked accounts. If verification fails, apply permanent suspension.</p>

        <h2>Documentation and Escalation Protocols</h2>
        <p>For all restrictions or suspensions, document findings in the user account and specify reasons based on collected evidence. Escalate unresolved cases via Slack for collaborative review.</p>
