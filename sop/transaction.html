        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Transaction SOP outlines the procedures for the Transaction Team in managing user transactions, monitoring for potential fraud, and resolving deposit and withdrawal inquiries.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor for suspicious transaction activities, including high-value deposits and coin mixing behaviors.</li>
            <li>Resolve inquiries related to deposits and withdrawals from users and customer service (CS) agents.</li>
            <li>Escalate complex cases to the Risk/Fraud/KYC team as needed for further review.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
        <h3>1. Initial Transaction Review</h3>
        <p>Begin by reviewing all user transactions, particularly for signs of suspicious behavior. Flag high-value deposits from unverified accounts and any deposit-withdrawal sequences that resemble coin mixing.</p>

        <h3>2. Resolving Deposit and Withdrawal Issues</h3>
        <p>When CS agents escalate inquiries regarding deposit or withdrawal issues, follow these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Network/Address:</strong> Inform the user that funds are unrecoverable if they used the wrong network or address.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending Transactions:</strong> Advise the user to wait for additional blockchain confirmations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Suspicious Activity Protocol</h3>
        <p>If you detect patterns of suspicious behavior, such as rapid withdrawals with no wagering, escalate the case to the Risk and Fraud teams for further analysis.</p>

        <h2>Escalation Protocols</h2>
        <p>For complex or unresolved cases, escalate the issue to the appropriate teams via Slack. Clearly document the reason for escalation, include details on suspected behavior, and tag relevant team members.</p>
